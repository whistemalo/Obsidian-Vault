#keep-alive
The HTTP Keep-Alive mechanism is implemented using specific headers in the HTTP protocol. The relevant headers include:

1. **Connection Header:**
    
    - `Connection: keep-alive` - This header is used to indicate that the connection should be kept open for further requests.
2. **Keep-Alive Header:**
    
    - `Keep-Alive: timeout=max[, max=requests]` - This header specifies the maximum time the server should keep the connection open (in seconds). Optionally, it may also specify the maximum number of requests that can be sent over the connection.

By default, many modern web servers and browsers support HTTP Keep-Alive, and it is often enabled by default. However, it's essential to note that the use of Keep-Alive may be subject to server and client configurations
